to understand release cadence. Good for: establishing context about project versioning patterns\n\n**Analyzing Current Changes:**\n- get_file_content: Use when diff alone isn't enough. Good for: understanding APIs, seeing full class/function context, checking imports\n- analyze_diff_section: Use to expand context around cryptic changes. Good for: seeing surrounding code, understanding integration points\n- get_file_dependencies: Use for refactors/moves.

Good for: organizing changes into logical themes, identifying what actually happened\n- analyze_commit_patterns: Use for many commits. Good for: detecting themes across commits, identifying if work is focused or scattered\n- get_release_stats: Use to quantify scope. Good for: getting concrete metrics on scale of changes\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- get_breaking_changes: Always use. Good for: identifying API changes, finding removals/signature changes that could break users\n- get_related_tests: Use for significant logic changes. Good for: understanding what behavior changed, verifying test coverage exists\n\n## Your Investigation Strategy\n\n1. **Start broad** (2-3 tools): get_tag_history, get_release_stats, analyze_commit_patterns\n2. **Identify themes** (1-2 tools): group_files_by_concern if many files, compare_previous_release for context\n3. **Deep dive** (3-5 tools): get_file_content for key changes, get_file_dependencies for refactors, analyze_diff_section for unclear changes\n4. **Verify understanding** (2-3 tools): get_related_tests for logic changes, search_codebase for impact\n5. **Check risks** (1 tool): get_breaking_changes always\n\nUse at least 6-8 tools per release to ensure comprehensive analysis. Each tool provides a different lens on the changes.\n\nOutput format:\nWhen you're ready to provide the final release notes, format them as JSON:\n\nRELEASE_NOTES:\n{\n  \"title\": \"A concise, single-line title capturing the most significant changes\",\n  \"body\": \"The detailed release notes in Markdown format, following best practices for structure, depth, and analysis\"\n}\n\nThe release notes should:\n- Demonstrate genuine understanding of the changes\n- Provide context and explain implications\n- Connect related changes to reveal patterns\n- Be substantial and analytical, not formulaic\n- Sound like they were written by a human who studied the changes\n- Be grounded in actual commits and issues (no hallucinations)\n- Be standalone documentation that can be published as-is\n- NEVER include conversational elements like \"If you want, I can also...\" or \"Let me know if...\"\n- NEVER offer follow-up actions, questions, or suggestions for additional work\n- End with substantive content, not conversational closing remarks"

don't rely only on the diff.\\n\\n## Guidelines\\n- Follow conventional commit format when appropriate (feat:, fix:, refactor:, docs:, test:, chore:)\\n- Consider suggesting split commits for unrelated changes\\n- Output only the commit message and/or splits -

The current release continues that pattern by advancing @eldrforge/git-tools to ^0.1.15 and locking the lockfile accordingly.\\n- The change set in this release is consistent with prior releases: mostly package metadata and developer-tooling maintenance rather than library API or behavior changes.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Technical details (concrete diffs)\\n\\n- package.json (key diffs):\\n  - \\\"version\\\": \\\"0.1.4\\\" (was \\\"0.1.4-dev.0\\\")\\n  - devDependencies: \\\"@eldrforge/git-tools\\\": \\\"^0.1.15\\\" (was \\\"^0.1.14\\\")\\n  - The rest of the package.json (exports, main, dependencies, devDependencies other entries) remains unchanged in intent; build/test scripts and published entry points are preserved.\\n\\n- package-lock.json:\\n  - Regenerated to reflect the devDependency bump; includes a resolved entry for @eldrforge/git-tools@0.1.15 in the lockfile's node_modules tree.\\n  - The lockfile also contains many transitive dev tooling entries (vite, vitest, eslint, etc.) but no changes affecting runtime dependencies used by consumers of the published package.\\n\\n- New doc: agentic-reflection-commit-2025-12-27T23-31-56.663Z.md; contains generated diagnostics and conversation history; no code.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Impact analysis (users and developers)\\n\\n- Consumers / downstream projects:\\n  - No functional changes to runtime dependencies or library code. The package API and exports were not modified.\\n  - Semver: the version change is a metadata promotion to a stable patch (0.1.4). Because this is a promotion from a prerelease identifier, dependency resolution by package managers will prefer the canonical 0.1.4 tag over any earlier prerelease identifiers.\\n  - There are no breaking changes detected in this release.\\n\\n- Maintainers / contributors:\\n  - Development tooling has been advanced (devDependency @eldrforge/git-tools to ^0.1.15) and the lockfile updated to reflect the exact resolution. The lockfile shows @eldrforge/git-tools resolved to 0.1.15 in node_modules.\\n  - A generated agentic reflection report was committed; it is documentation/test output rather than source.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Breaking changes and risk assessment\\n\\n- get_breaking_changes analysis: no obvious breaking changes were detected between main → HEAD for runtime code.\\n- The package version promotion and devDependency bump are low-risk changes:\\n  - Version promotion changes only package metadata.\\n  - DevDependency bump affects only developer-time tooling; nothing in the published bundle or runtime dependency set was changed.\\n- The new document is an additive file and does not impact built artifacts or library exports.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Release provenance (commits and files)\\n\\n- Commits included in this release range (main → HEAD):\\n  - 0e87980597ade4dc1160ab31789664285fe722ec — chore(release): promote @eldrforge/shared to 0.1.4\\n  - cef7a57f48f5703256360ca357c15e46b6a4a89e — chore(deps): bump @eldrforge/git-tools devDependency to ^0.1.15 and regenerate package-lock\\n  - c18bc06411d7d8cc5a6fcdb92855237491d8db74 — chore: add agentic reflection report from testing\\n\\n- Files changed in the diff set:\\n  - package.json (version bump, devDependency bump)\\n  - package-lock.json (regenerated to lock devDependency resolution)\\n  - agentic-reflection-commit-2025-12-27T23-31-56.663Z.md (new documentation / test artifact)\\n\\n- Git tags and recent release history (representative):\\n  - The project has an established cadence of promoting prerelease tags to stable releases (examples: v0.1.2, v0.1.3, and now v0.1.4). The repository shows tags such as v0.1.3 and v0.1.4-dev.0 in the recent history.\\n\\n---\\n\\n## Plain-language summary\\n\\nThis release formalizes a stable package version (0.1.4), updates the development toolset (@eldrforge/git-tools → ^0.1.15) with a regenerated lockfile, and commits a generated agentic reflection report. There are no runtime changes or breaking API changes; the work is housekeeping and artifact capture that keeps the repository metadata and developer tooling current.\"\n}"

## Summary

This release contains three small, focused changes landed on HEAD since main:

- Promotion of @eldrforge/shared from a prerelease identifier to a stable release (0.1.4). Commit: 0e87980597ade4dc1160ab31789664285fe722ec
- A development-tooling bump: devDependency @eldrforge/git-tools updated from ^0.1.14 → ^0.1.15 and package-lock regenerated. Commit: cef7a57f48f5703256360ca357c15e46b6a4a89e
- Addition of an agentic self‑reflection report (documentation / test artifact). Commit: c18bc06411d7d8cc5a6fcdb92855237491d8db74

All changes are small and deliberate; there are no functional/runtime changes to the published library code.

- Scope: metadata-only; no source code, exports, or runtime behavior were changed.
- Commit: 0e87980597ade4dc1160ab31789664285fe722ec — "chore(release): promote @eldrforge/shared to 0.1.4".

2) Dev tooling bump + lockfile regeneration
- package.json devDependencies: "@eldrforge/git-tools" ^0.1.14 → ^0.1.15.
- package-lock.json regenerated and now contains node_modules/@eldrforge/git-tools at 0.1.15.
- Rationale in commit: update development tooling; explicitly noted as a development-only change with no runtime/production dependency modifications.
- Commit: cef7a57f48f5703256360ca357c15e46b6a4a89e — "chore(deps): bump @eldrforge/git-tools devDependency to ^0.1.15 and regenerate package-lock".

3) Add agentic reflection report (documentation / testing artifact)
- New file: agentic-reflection-commit-2025-12-27T23-31-56.663Z.md (55 lines). The file contains a generated "Agentic Workflow - Self-Reflection Report" from a testing/execution run.
- Purpose: human-readable artifact produced during testing/execution — preserves the execution summary and conversation history that produced the commit message in context.
- Commit: c18bc06411d7d8cc5a6fcdb92855237491d8db74 — "chore: add agentic reflection report from testing".

## Context and relation to prior releases

- This repository follows a clear and repeated pattern across recent commits: frequent, small release promotions that remove the prerelease (-dev.*) suffix and mark the package as stable (examples: promotions to 0.1.2, 0.1.3 and now 0.1.4).
- Alongside each promotion there have been periodic dev-tooling bumps (multiple recent commits show incremental updates to @eldrforge/git-tools). The current release continues that pattern by advancing @eldrforge/git-tools to ^0.1.15 and locking the lockfile accordingly.
- The change set in this release is consistent with prior releases: mostly package metadata and developer-tooling maintenance rather than library API or behavior changes.

## Technical details (concrete diffs)

- package.json (key diffs):
  - "version": "0.1.4" (was "0.1.4-dev.0")
  - devDependencies: "@eldrforge/git-tools": "^0.1.15" (was "^0.1.14")
  - The rest of the package.json (exports, main, dependencies, devDependencies other entries) remains unchanged in intent; build/test scripts and published entry points are preserved.

- package-lock.json:
  - Regenerated to reflect the devDependency bump; includes a resolved entry for @eldrforge/git-tools@0.1.15 in the lockfile's node_modules tree.
  - The lockfile also contains many transitive dev tooling entries (vite, vitest, eslint, etc.) but no changes affecting runtime dependencies used by consumers of the published package.

- New doc: agentic-reflection-commit-2025-12-27T23-31-56.663Z.md; contains generated diagnostics and conversation history; no code.

---

## Impact analysis (users and developers)

- Consumers / downstream projects:
  - No functional changes to runtime dependencies or library code. The package API and exports were not modified.
  - Semver: the version change is a metadata promotion to a stable patch (0.1.4). Because this is a promotion from a prerelease identifier, dependency resolution by package managers will prefer the canonical 0.1.4 tag over any earlier prerelease identifiers.
  - There are no breaking changes detected in this release.

- Maintainers / contributors:
  - Development tooling has been advanced (devDependency @eldrforge/git-tools to ^0.1.15) and the lockfile updated to reflect the exact resolution. The lockfile shows @eldrforge/git-tools resolved to 0.1.15 in node_modules.
  - A generated agentic reflection report was committed; it is documentation/test output rather than source.

---

## Breaking changes and risk assessment

- get_breaking_changes analysis: no obvious breaking changes were detected between main → HEAD for runtime code.
- The package version promotion and devDependency bump are low-risk changes:
  - Version promotion changes only package metadata.
  - DevDependency bump affects only developer-time tooling; nothing in the published bundle or runtime dependency set was changed.
- The new document is an additive file and does not impact built artifacts or library exports.

## Plain-language summary

This release formalizes a stable package version (0.1.4), updates the development toolset (@eldrforge/git-tools → ^0.1.15) with a regenerated lockfile, and commits a generated agentic reflection report. There are no runtime changes or breaking API changes; the work is housekeeping and artifact capture that keeps the repository metadata and developer tooling current.
