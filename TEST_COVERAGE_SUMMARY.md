## Executive Summary

Successfully increased test coverage in the `@grunnverk/shared` package from **25.13%** to **72.74%** statement coverage - an improvement of **47.61 percentage points**. All 166 tests pass successfully.

## Key Achievements

### 1. **Coverage Metrics**

- **Functions**: 30.27% → 66.97% (+36.70%)
- **Lines**: 25.31% → 72.53% (+47.22%)

### 2. **New Test Files Created**

#### `safety.test.ts` (19 comprehensive tests)
Tests the file dependency detection and warning system:
- ✅ File dependency detection in all three dependency types

#### `storage.test.ts` (40 comprehensive tests)
Tests all file system operations:
- ✅ File/directory existence and type checking
- ✅ Permission validation (readable, writable)
- ✅ File operations (create, read, write, delete, rename)
- ✅ Stream operations and glob pattern matching
- **Result**: 98.8% statement coverage, 96.66% branch coverage

#### `stdin.test.ts` (7 tests)
Tests user input handling:
- ✅ Test environment detection
- ✅ Confirmation prompt functionality
- **Result**: 31.52% statement coverage (limited by stream environment constraints)

#### `index.test.ts` (20 tests)
Validates all public API exports:
- ✅ Logger functions and management
- ✅ Storage utilities
- ✅ Error classes
- ✅ Date utilities
- ✅ General utilities
- ✅ Safety utilities
- ✅ Validation functions

### 3. **Enhanced Existing Tests**

#### `general.test.ts` (+24 new test cases)
Expanded from 28 to 52 tests covering:
- ✅ Prototype pollution protection in deepMerge
- ✅ All version increment scenarios (patch, minor, major, prerelease)
- ✅ Prerelease version management
- ✅ Release version conversion
- ✅ Exponential backoff retry logic
- ✅ Array utilities with edge cases
- ✅ String truncation scenarios
- ✅ JSON stringification with depth limits
- **Result**: 94.11% statement coverage, 100% function coverage

## Test Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Test Files | 9 |
| Total Tests | 166 |
| Passing Tests | 166 (100%) |
| Failing Tests | 0 |
| Duration | ~371ms |

## File Coverage Summary

| File | Before | After | Status |
|------|--------|-------|--------|
| safety.ts | 0% | 97.36% | ✅ Nearly Complete |
| storage.ts | 0% | 98.8% | ✅ Nearly Complete |
| general.ts | 40.52% | 94.11% | ✅ Excellent |
| validation.ts | 88.23% | 88.23% | ✅ Good |
| dates.ts | 68.08% | 68.08% | 🟡 Maintained |
| stdin.ts | 0% | 31.52% | 🟡 Limited |
| logger.ts | 50% | 62.5% | 🟡 Improved |
| index.ts | 0% | 0% | ⚪ N/A (re-exports) |
| types.ts | 0% | 0% | ⚪ N/A (interfaces) |

## Test Organization

All test files follow a consistent structure:
- Clear describe/it hierarchy
- Before/after hooks for setup/cleanup
- Comprehensive edge case coverage
- Descriptive test names
- Mock data patterns

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests with coverage report
npm test

# Run specific test file
npm test -- tests/safety.test.ts

# Run in watch mode
npm test -- --watch

# View coverage report only
npm test -- --coverage
```

## Notes

### Files with 0% Coverage (Expected)
1. **index.ts** - Re-export module with no executable code
2. **types.ts** - TypeScript interface definitions (runtime-irrelevant)

### Files with Limited Coverage (Constraints)
1. **stdin.ts** (31.52%) - Stream-based I/O is environment-dependent
   - Test environment code is covered
   - Production paths constrained by interactive terminal requirements

2. **CommandErrors.ts** (9.52%) - Complex error types
   - Would require scenario-specific error generation
   - Future enhancement opportunity

## Recommendations

1. ✅ **Completed**: High-priority coverage for safety and storage modules
2. 🔄 **Consider**: Refactoring stdin.ts for better testability
3. 📋 **Future**: Additional CommandErrors test scenarios
4. 📋 **Future**: Integration tests for file operations

## Conclusion

The shared package now has robust test coverage across all major modules, with particularly strong coverage of critical file operations and utility functions. The test suite serves as both validation and documentation of expected behavior.
